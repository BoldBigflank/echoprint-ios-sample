# echoprint-ios-sample

Very brief sample of how to use echoprint in an iOS app. This will choose a file from your library, compute the code with Echoprint and send it to the Echo Nest API for matching.

You will need to have compiled libechoprint-codegen-ios.a, which you can compile using the Xcode project in echoprint-codegen.
